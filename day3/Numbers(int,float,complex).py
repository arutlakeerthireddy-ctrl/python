#Numbers(int,float,complex)
Numbers are built in dataypes in python to store numeric values.
There are three types of numbers in python:

#1.int(integer)
stores whole numbers,positive or negative without decimal point.
Ex:a=19
   b=-45
   c=0
#key features:
1.unlimited size
2.supports arithmetic operations(+,-,*,/,//,%,**)
3.supports type conversion to float and complex
4.immutable

#2.float
represents real numbers with decimal point.
Ex:d=3.14
   e=-0.001
   f=2.0
#key features:
1.accurate up to 15 decimal places
2.supports arithmetic operations(+,-,*,/,//,%,**)
3.supports type conversion to int and complex
4.immutable

#3.complex
used to store complex numbers with real and imaginary parts.
Ex:g=4+5j
   h=-2-3j
   i=0+1j
#key features:
1.real and imaginary parts are represented as float
2.supports arithmetic operations(+,-,*,/)
3.supports type conversion to float and int(not directly)
4.immutable
